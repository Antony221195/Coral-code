This sub-repository contains the experimental data for coral's flow field obtained from PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) and Oxygen map obtained via (sensPIV).
.mat files are visualised using MATLAB
Flow_field_without_external_flow.mat gives the coral's flow field in the absence of external shear (Given in Fig.3(b))
Flow_field_with_external_flow.mat gives the coral's flow field in the presence of external shear (shear rate= 0.5 s^{-1}) (Given in Fig.~5(b)).
Oxygen_Profile.mat gives the oxygen map given in Fig.~7(b).
Velocity_Profile_for_Oxygen_Profile.mat gives the coral's flow field (with external shear) while measuring the oxygen profile (Given in Fig.~7(b)).
